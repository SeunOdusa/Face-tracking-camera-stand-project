# Face-tracking-camera-stand-project
Built a face tracking camera using Python, Arduino, and OpenCV. Included a Tkinter GUI with three modes: face tracking, hand gesture tracking, and manual control via buttons or arrow keys. Used servo motors for real-time camera movement based on target detection.
